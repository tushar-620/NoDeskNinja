      <p>Dear Chudail,</p>
      <p>Thankyou for coming in my life.<br>
        these years have been my best years of my life because of you.
        it's all thanks to you I got to enjoy this years without having 
        to worry too much and I was able to share my thoughts to you and 
        I was able to learn a lot of things because of you. And I got to 
        have someone to share my thoughts and all day stories.
      </p>
      <p>I don't need your all attention or your whole times.<br>      
      I just need few moment.</p>
      <p>You’ve been my sister in more ways than one — annoying, protective, sarcastic, supportive… all of it.</p>
      <p>You called me Khadus, and somehow I like this title and have no problem, because you gave it to me.</p>
      <p>This Rakshabandhan, I made this for you.<br>
      No gifts, no fansy items — just a little corner on the internet that says: <strong>"You're irreplaceable, Chudail."</strong></p>
      <p>– Your Khadus 🧿</p>
